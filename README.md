# Storage Sorter
A Fabric server-side mod to autosort items into your storage system. This mod only needs to be installed on the server to work.

## Setup
By default the wooden hoe is your storage tool.

Shift-left click a barrel with a redstone block under it to create or select it as sorting input. With that selected you are now able to add storage containers like chests to that input by shift-right clicking it with the wooden hoe.

From now on, Items in the input barrel are moved to storage containers with that same item in it. If the container is full or the item is not yet inside of any container, the item will stay inside of the input barrel.
